# Unit 6 | Assignment - What's the Weather Like?

#1:
Due to earth's land distribution there are more cities in the northern hemisphere.  The plots have more cities above 0° (latitude). In the northern hemisphere, many cities are greater than 60°. While in the south, cities beyond higher than absolute value of 40° are sparse. On average, 70% of the data are greater than 0°.
#2:
The world temperature is curvilinear, correlating with latitude. Lower absolute latitude values have higher temperatures while higher absolute latitude values have lower relative temperatures. The apex of the curve favors the northern hemisphere by roughly 20 degrees because the northern hemisphere is experiencing summer, i.e. the northern part of the earth is tilted toward the sun.
#3: 
There does not appear to be a clear correlation of cloud cover nor wind with latitude.  Humidity is trickier. Due to there being more continental climates, i.e. large land masses, in the northern hemisphere (See answer 1), there is a wider distribution of humidity values. Humidity of the southern hemisphere is skewed left below -30° because large, contiguous land masses are rarer meaning cities are more influenced by a nearby bodies of water. Also, humidity seems to set fewer low values around the equator (+/- 20° due to season) leading one to perhaps posit the probability of experiencing over 60% humidity increases around 0°.
